# Contact Information

Include contact information so anyone can quickly determine who to can contact and how to contact them if they have a problem or need to ask a question.

> **List Your Preferred Method of Communication**
>
> If you have a preferred method of communication, make sure to list it here and provide any instructions needed to use or access that method.

Also, provide on-call information so everyone knows exactly who to contact in an emergency situation. If a product specifies an SLA or level of support, (e.g. immediate support during business hours Eastern time, but only best after outside those hours) list that here.

If an on-call rotation is established, enter it here. If a managed service provider is being used, make sure to detail how to contact them. If the client is providing support, that information should be listed. If none of these are in place, then it is time to have a conversation to determine a support strategy.

> On-call rotations are a necessary evil, but the best way to make being on-call painless is to build a production ready product. A production ready product is one that is: _stable_, _reliable_, _scalable_, _fault tolerant_, _prepared for catastrophes_, _performant_, _monitored_, and _documented_.
