# Production Ready Documentation


### What is Production Ready Documentation?

Production ready documentation is documentation that can be trusted to support a product running production traffic. This means the documentation is complete, up-to-date, and readily available. The documentation includes all the relevant and essential information necessary to understand the product.

Good documentation increases developer productivity, helps resolve issues faster, and creates a shared understanding of the product. This is because product ready documentation adopts a "self-service" mindset, where the documentation provides all the information for a person to solve their own problems just by reading the documentation.

To assist in creation of production ready documentation, this [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/) was created as a self service tool.
